# 📊 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Final Project

This project is a **C++ Windows Forms Application** built in **Visual Studio** as part of the Final Year Data Structures & Algorithms coursework.  
It demonstrates key DSA concepts through an interactive **graphical user interface (GUI)**.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
- **Windows OS**
- **Visual Studio 2019/2022** (with C++ Desktop Development workload installed)
- .NET Framework support (installed by default with Visual Studio)

### 2️⃣ Steps to Build & Run
1. Clone this repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Talha-2.git
   cd Talha-2


2. Open `final_dsa_project.vcxproj` in **Visual Studio**.
3. Make sure the configuration is set to:

   * **Debug / Release** (based on preference)
   * **x86** platform (WinForms supports 32-bit builds more smoothly)
4. Press **F5** or click **Start Debugging** to build and run.

---

## 🖥️ Usage

* The GUI will launch upon running the project.
* Interact with the provided buttons and fields to explore the implemented **data structures and algorithms**.
* The main project logic is implemented in **TheCode.h**, which integrates with the GUI through `MyForm.cpp`.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Interactive **Windows Form GUI** for visualizing algorithms.
* Modular structure (`TheCode.h`) for separating UI and logic.
* Built using **C++/CLI with .NET WinForms** for educational purposes.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add more algorithm visualizations.
* Improve UI design with modern controls.
* Extend support for 64-bit builds.
